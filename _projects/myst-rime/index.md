title: Myst Rime Update
description:  In 2025, we updated our Unreal Engine version of Myst with the long-awaited Rime age, from RealMyst.
  I lead the gameplay design on this update, translating the old puzzles to new, more modern designs that worked
  for all our target platforms, including PC2D, console with controller, and VR. 
skills: 
- UE5
